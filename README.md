About Atlantic African Diaspora History

Atlantic African Diaspora histories explore the life and culture of people of African descent in Africa, Europe, and the Americas.  The period of Atlantic slavery and slave trading is of special interest.  More specific themes include:

Forced migrations of Africans from across the African continent to the Americas and to Europe
Communities formed by people of African descent on both sides of the Atlantic
Alliances forged and broken and the impact of slavery, slave trades, colonization, revolution, and emancipation on societies of color (some “black,” others not) as they formed.
Atlantic African Diaspora history intersects with Atlantic and national histories of empire and the early modern world.  The field is also interdisciplinary, supporting and supported by research emerging from the fields of African, Africana/African-American, and Latin American studies; women, gender, and sexuality studies; and feminist, post-colonial, and race theory.
